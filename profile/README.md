# Sphynx

Sphynx is primarily an operating system. But it actually host's multiple tools and programs, such as [Sphynx](https://github.com/sphynxos/Sphynx)(An operating system), [sphynxboot](https://github.com/sphynxos/sphynxboot)(A bootloader).

## Current Idea

We want to create a simple but yet powerful operating system for modern x86_64 systems.

## Other Ideas

We also have an idea in mind, to create our custom architecture and CPU (and emulator) then write a full bootloader for it and port Sphynxs (the OS) to it.
